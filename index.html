		<h2>Eating out with children in London</h2>

		<p>When eating out with children, it’s all too easy to plump for the safe option, and simply head to your local restaurant chain. The kid’s menu is the usual uninspiring blend of chicken and chips, pizza or spaghetti Bolognese, whilst the adult menu is often underwhelming and no different to the mid week meals that you whip up yourself at home.</p>
		
		<p>Here at Tiny Diners, we are on a mission to help families step outside the safety zone and find great places to eat in London. These restaurants will offer a welcoming environment for young children as well as good quality food and thoughtful menus.</p>
		
		<p>So, here we bring you a collection of reviews for a range of restaurants – from our favourite local spots to child-friendly, central London eateries. It’s time for you to enjoy eating out again with your tiny diners!</p>
